float.timeline.js

A series of enhancements made to flot that add
   an overview graph
   ability to show / hide series by clicking them in the legend
   automatic Y-axis scaling when selecting a range in the overview graph
   tooltip showing all data for that point in time
   Support for 'this-unit' series containing the most recent data, separated out since it is not final data
   Automatic data update via AJAX

I acknowledge that this should all be in a flot plugin and that in order to use this, it would be a bit of work to pull the customizations out.
Mostly I'm putting this out there in case anybody else was trying to mimic the Google Docs Timeline graph.
Hopefully I'll have the time in the future to make this into a proper flot plugin.

This code requires jQuery, flot, flot.navigate, flot.time, and flot.selection.
